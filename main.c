 *
 * Chutes and Ladders game. The while loop in main continues to call move on each
 * player's pointer and prints the results of each round of moves to a file until
 * one of the pointers reaches the end of the board (board + 100). Move generates
 * a random number from 1 to 6, moves the players pointer forward that many
 * tiles, and checks the contents of the tile. Landing on an 'F' or a 'B' calls
 * the findHaven function, moves the player either forward or backward depending
 * on the value to the nearest available haven, designated 'H', and replaces the
 * 'H' with a '_' so the haven cannot be used again. Landing a lowercase letter
 * calls the chuteLadder function. The chuteLadder function takes the ascii value
 * of the character found on the tile and subtracts it form 110 and moves the
 * player the resulting number of spaces the player moves. Positive values move
 * the player forward and negative values move the player backwards (landing on
 * an 'n' does nothing as the ascii value for n = 110. The letter that was landed
 * on is then changed to a '*' so that it cannot be used again. The results of
 * every roll and the number of spaces moved is printed to the console. Once a
 * players pointer reaches the end of the board (board + 100) the winner is
 * declared and the game is terminated.
